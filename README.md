# S2I_Node.js_Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey to understand and implement **RESTful APIs using Node.js** and **MongoDB**.

## üìö Purpose

The goal of this project was to build a simple backend application that allows:

- Creating, updating, and deleting users
- Managing products sold (with a simple `name` attribute)
- Creating and managing sales orders containing users and products
- Filtering and retrieving orders by insertion date and products involved

By building this project, I practiced the following concepts:

- Setting up an Express.js server
- Designing RESTful API endpoints using proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Connecting to a MongoDB database using Mongoose
- Creating Mongoose models and schemas
- Performing CRUD operations
- Handling request validation and error responses
- Using `.gitignore` and publishing code on GitHub

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**  
- **Postman** (for testing API endpoints)  
- **Git** & **GitHub** (for version control)

## üß™ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/S2I_Node.js_Project.git
   cd S2I_Node.js_Project
